			<h2 id="part1">Part I: Setting up the grid</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>In <code>lab4-style.css</code>, select the class with 
					name <code>grid-container</code> and create a grid layout
					according to the image below:</li>
					<img src="https://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~aestey/csc130/labs/lab4/images/grid-layout.png" width="60%" />
				<li>Write CSS so that the class named <code>main</code>, which includes
					these instructions, go in the middle column.</li>
				<li>Next, place the navigation bar in the left column, and
					the class named <code>right</code> in the right column</li>
				<li>Write a css rule so that the classes named <code>left</code>
					and <code>right</code> both have a background-color 
					of <code>#470809</code></li>
				<li>The navigation bar class is currently displayed using a 
					flexbox where the contents are spread across a single row.
					Update the flexbox configuration so that the contents
					inside the flexbox span down a column instead of across a row.</li>
				<li>Save your <code>lab4-style.css</code> file, and refresh 
					the <code>lab4.html</code> page in your browser. The page 
					should now look like the image below:</li>

			<h2 id="part2">Part II: Fixing the Grid</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>At this point, you have likely noticed that these instructions
				go below where the grid box ends. That is because the grid box is 
				defined to only span 100% of the height and width of your browser.
				There are two ways to fix this: (1) Set it so that column and/or 
				row sizes sum to beyond 100%. (2) Set it so that specific elements 
				in the grid box have a scroll bar if their contents exceed their 
				allocated grid lines. We will implement te second option for this lab.
				In the rule-set for the class with name <code>main</code> there should
				currently be rules to place the <code>main</code> class in the center
				column of the grid. Add the following rules to the declaration block:
				<ul>
					<code>max-height:100%;</code><br>
					<code>overflow-y: auto;</code>
				</ul>
				The <code>max-height</code> allows us to set a max-height for the
				selected element. In ths case, we are saying the content in the
				<code>main</code> class cannot exceed <code>100%</code> of the height
				we have specified for it in the grid. The <code>overflow-y</code>
				allows us to specify what happens if it overflows the maximum height, 
				the <code>default</code> makes it so that a scroll bar appears. If
				you save and refresh the page, the navigation bar on the left should
				stay positioned in the center of the browser, but you should be able
				to scroll up and down the lab instructions in the <code>main</code>
				part of the page (or click the links on the navigation bar).</li>
			<li>Make a few more touch-ups to the <code>main</code> class.
				<ol>
					<li>Give the <code>main</code> class a background color
					(I went with a light grey, which you will see below)</li>
					<li>Add 20px of padding</li>
					<li>Add a border to the left and right side of the <code>main</code> class</li>
				</ol>
				<li>The image below shows my page after adding some side borders
				and a background color to the <code>main</code> class: </li>

			<h2 id="part3">Part III: Uploading to UVic Servers</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>If you are using a lab machine click the Windows icon 
				on the bottom-left-corner of the screen, and then type in 
				WinSCP to open up the WinSCP program. WinSCP is a program 
				that allows you to connect to a web server from your computer 
				and transfer files between your device and the server.<br> 
				If you are not working on a lab machine, and are using a Windows 
				computer, you can download WinSCP for free here: 
				<a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">https://winscp.net/eng/download.php</a><br>
				There are other alternatives if you would prefer to use a different program. 
				The following two also work for non-Windows users: 
				<ul>
					<li>CyberDuck (<a href="https://cyberduck.io/download/">https://cyberduck.io/download/</a>) and</li>
					<li>FileZilla (<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1">https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1</a>) 
				</ul></li>
				<li>Once you have one of the programs from Step 1 running, 
				the next step is to connect to a web server. UVic provides free 
				web hosting, and so we will send out files to the UVic servers. 
				There are many other hosts out there, and you are free to use other 
				web servers outside of UVic was well. The following steps will 
				lead you through how to connect to the UVic web servers:
				<ol>
					<li>Make sure the protocol you have selected is SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)</li>
					<li>There should be a box where you can enter a server or host name. 
					In that box, fill in the following: <code>sftp.csc.uvic.ca</code></li>
					<li>Next, enter your user name and password <u>(this should be the 
					same username and password you use to login to BrightSpace or the lab computers)</u></li>
					<li>Click <code>Login</code> (or <code>Connect</code>, or something similar!)</li>

				<img class="setup" src="https://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~aestey/csc130/labs/lab4/images/cyberduck-setup.png" width="60%" /><br><br>
				<li>If the login was successful, you should see a screen similar to 
				what is shown below. The window is split into two parts: the left half 
				is the files on your machine, and the right half is files on the web server.
				In Cyberduck, only the files on the web server are shown (which right now is 
				just a folder called <code>public_html</code>)<br>
				You can drag files from one window to another, and WinSCP (and other similar 
				programs) will copy the file from the source to the destination. 
				For example, if I drag <code>lab4.html</code> from my computerâ€™s lab4 folder on the left, 
				into the <code>public_html</code> folder on the web server on the right, the file will 
				be copied onto the web server (<b>NOTE:</b> You must drag the file into the 
				<code>public_html</code> folder on the web server)</li>

			<ol>
				<li>Go to <code>https://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~userID/lab4.html</code> where userID 
				is replaced your login name (the one you use to login to BrightSpace and the lab 
				computers. For example, my webpage would be <code>http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~aestey/lab4.html</code></li>
				<li>Try viewing the page on your mobile phone. Depending on the resolution, the layout of the 
				page may be different that when viewing it at full-screen on a computer monitor.</li>
